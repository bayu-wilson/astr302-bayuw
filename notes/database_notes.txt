We can combine the power of SQL and Python with Astroquery. Astroquery is a set of tools for querying astronomical web forms and databases, from Python.

conda install -c astropy astroquery

The -c astropy tells conda to download astroquery from the astropy channel.

Do
from astroquery.sdss import SDSS

Don't
import astroquery

Astroquery is a set of related tools for querying different astronomical database services, e.g. SIMBAD, VizieR, and IRSA-IPAC, and for retrieving data from archives, e.g. the ESO, IRSA, and NRAO archives. It also includes tools for querying other astronomy-related databases such as line-list servers at NIST (primarily for optical/NIR electronic transitions) and Splatalogue for mm/radio molecular transitions.

SIMBAD is the acronym for Set of Identifications, Measurements and Bibliography for Astronomical Data.

Tutorial based on: https://github.com/ESO-python/ESOPythonTutorials

We can query by both name and position.

Splatalogue ("spectral line catalogue") provides access to mm lines.
