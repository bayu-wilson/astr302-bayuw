Noise:
Poisson
Instrumental
Readout noise

Sky:
Sky brightness


Sky noise is dominant. The noise is from our atmosphere. 

Point spread function (PSF): 
It tells you how a point gets spread to adjacent pixels. 
Stars should really be like tiny points in the sky. PSF is why they aren't! Understanding this is vital to make good measurements.

How should we measure flux of an object?
- Aperture Photometry:
You could do aperture photometry. You define an aperture (circle,ellipse etc). Then measure how many counts there are in an aperture.

Increasing size of aperature will increase noise but won't increase signal. You can optimally set size by maximizing the signal to noise.

- Forward Modeling:
This is 30% better. There is no better estimator than this. Model fitting. Use chi**2 test.
