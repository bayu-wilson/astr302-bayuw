Course Objectives
- Slack
- Anaconda

Notes
- Check is ASTR 324 will be available Sp 17
- We use python because time costs money. Computers are fast enough to use a high-level language like python. 
While a low-level language may be faster it may lose time in the end aka cost money.
- The best tools WILL change over time. The best thing to do is to be an effective learner
- Statisticians use R.
- Julia is a lot like python. Apparently like python. Like German from English.
- Scala. Similar to python. Functional programming language. Like Mandarin from English. Different perspective.
